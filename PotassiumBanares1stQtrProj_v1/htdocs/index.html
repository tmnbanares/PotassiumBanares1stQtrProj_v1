	<h2> Historical Background</h2>
	<p> Diverse regions of the Philippine Archipelago were home to communities with vibrant and diverse cultures. The arrival of the Spaniards, however, had a significant impact on Philippine history. The Philippines of today have seen changes from the Spanish colonial era in aspects such as administration, tradition, and culture. The development of townships marked the beginning of the division between those who embraced Spanish and Christian influence and those who resisted. Those who stayed outside the towns were pushed farther into the mountains and forests. They were regarded as infideles (non-Christians and anti-Christians) and remontados (those who fled to the hills) because they maintained their old customs and traditions.

However, anyone who resisted joining the towns were still subject to Spanish regulations. According to the jura regalia doctrine, all of the islands in the Philippine archipelago were considered to belong to the Spanish crown (Regalian Doctrine). The Philippines' lands were governed by new Spanish land laws by the 19th century. The foundation for grants from the Spanish crown became land rights. Those lacking land titles possessed no legitimate claim to the land. The indigenous people who chose to live outside of cities and who refused to be subject to Spanish land rules therefore had almost no legal claim to their own land.</p>

	<p>The Regalian Doctrine
 was upheld by the U.S. colonial government and implemented land laws to control public lands. It wanted the distribution of uncultivated, uninhabited, and potentially agricultural public lands to anyone who desired their use, including U.S. citizens. These lands covered the indigenous peoples' historical homelands. The Public Land Act of 1902 governed the disposition of the lands of the “public domain.” A company might lease or purchase up to 1,024 hectares of property under the Public Land Act of 1902, and any tract or tracts of the public domain could be set aside for the sole use of non-Christian indigenous. Claimants could apply for homestead, buy, lease, or confirm claims to the land. The same provision deemed invalid and void any disposition or transfer of land rights made by non-Christian indigenous if neither the previous Spanish colonial administration nor the U.S. colonial government had given its consent. All lands were subject to a land title system under the 1902 Land Registration Act No. 496, which also provided the government the authority to grant proofs of title to eligible applicants. According to Philippine Commission Act No. 178 of 1903 the State alone had the authority to categorize and utilize any unregistered land as public domain. The American colonists were granted the power to mine public lands under the 1905 Mining Act.</p>

	<p>The IPRA ushered a new era of settling land claims, this time involving native peoples and their ancestral lands. The formation of such claims did not, however, necessarily solve their land issues. Two years prior, a different law that dealt with indigenous tribes' claims to land with mineral resources was passed. The Philippine Mining Act of 1957 was passed well aware of how it might impact ancestral lands. Ancestral lands are defined, and it says that they cannot be made available for mining operations "without the prior consent of the indigenous cultural community concerned,” and in case the community gives its consent “royalty payment, upon utilization of the minerals shall be agreed upon by the parties.” Although the indigenous peoples' right to their land was acknowledged by these provisions, the law's actual implementation affected their communities. </p>

<p> Indigenous peoples in the Philippines nowadays are divided into many ethnic groups and live in various regions of the nation. There are about 100 indigenous communities, around 61% of which are in Mindanao, 33% in Luzon, and 6% in the Visayas, according to NCIP (2010). In order to secure and safeguard their way of life from the influence of contemporary lifestyles, some communities are physically isolated, although many were forced to reside in mountains and forests ever since towns and cities were built. This does not, however, protect them from prejudice brought on by negative views of the Filipino people, and by the mistreatment of the government. Many people were made to flee their lands and homes, and some were murdered, imprisoned, and tortured because they were thought to be affiliated with armed opposition organizations. Their continued poverty is a result of a lack of access to essential social services, healthcare, education, sustainable livelihoods, and farm-to-market roads. The attack of consumerism and contemporary culture frequently came at the price of preserving their cultural identity.
